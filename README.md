# malaria_images
The Jupyter notebook contains code to design, train, and evaluate a CNN (convolutional neural network) that differentiates between images of malaria-infected cells and images of uninfected cells. The image data was obtained from https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets and contains 27558 cell images (with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells), out of which I randomly assigned 10000 images to the test set for evaluation purposes. Like the training set, the test set also has equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.

I designed the CNN using the Keras library. The image classifier consists of convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected layers. There are 2 convolutional layers, each of which contains 32 kernels with a 3x3 receptive field and a stride of 1. To introduce more variety to the training data, I augment the training images with transformations (zoom, shear, horizontal flip). After training the CNN for 10 epochs, it managed to correctly classify 92% of the images in the test set.
